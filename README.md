* Behavior: Type in a single number for multiple sides.
    * Input: "side1" = 2; "side2" = 2; "side3" = 2
    * Output: 2, 2, 2
* Behavior: Returns if sides make up a triangle or not.
    * Input: "side1" = 2; "side2" = 2; "side3" = 88;
    * Output: "not a triangle"

    * Input: "side1" = 2; "side2" = 2; "side3" = 2
    * Output: "Equalateral..."
* Behavior: Returns isosceles, if two sides are equal.
    * Input: "side1" = 2; "side2" = 2; "side3" = 3
    * Output: "Isosceles..."
* Behavior: Returns scalene, if two sides are equal.
    * Input: "side1" = 2; "side2" = 1; "side3" = 3
